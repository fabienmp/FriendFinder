# UC Berkeley Extension : Homework #11
## Friend Finder App

This application is a full-stack site that takes in results from surveys, then compare the answers with those existing in the database. The app will then display the answers and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Input Validation

Jquery Validate is a quick way to setup input validation for page. This works especially well when there are numerous inputs.

```
        $("form[name='surveyForm']").validate({
        rules: {
            friendName: "required",
            photoLink: "required",
            q1: "required",
            q2: "required",
            q3: "required",
            q4: "required",
            q5: "required",
            q6: "required",         
            q7: "required",       
            q8: "required",           
            q9: "required",     
            q10: "required",
        }
```

## ORM

The javascript model was generated using the Sequelize CLI command Model:Generate. 
The folder structure was generated by the command Sequelize init.

## Database 

I used an instance of JawsDB in order to quickly attach a database to the application hosted on Heroku.
JawsDB is a MySQL instance that can be accessed locally using the credentials provided on the Add-On dashboard on Heroku.

## Source Control

I used github as it is the industry standard in the industry. The github repository can also be associated the application on Heroku, making deployments seamless.
